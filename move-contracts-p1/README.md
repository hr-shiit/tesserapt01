# Pendle-Style Yield Tokenization Protocol on Aptos

A complete DeFi protocol implementing Pendle's yield tokenization mechanics on Aptos blockchain with real token transfers using the native coin framework.

---

## 🎯 What We Built

A production-ready yield tokenization protocol that allows users to:
- **Stake APT** and earn 9.5% APY through stAPT tokens
- **Wrap yield-bearing assets** into standardized SY tokens
- **Split yield** into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT)
- **Trade PT/YT** on an automated market maker (AMM)
- **Provide liquidity** and earn trading fees

## 📜 Transaction History & Development Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (Oracles & Staking)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Built the foundational layer with price oracles and staking:
- Integrated Pyth Network for real-time APT price feeds ($3.40)
- Created stAPT token with 9.5% APY auto-compounding
- Implemented mock tokens (USDC) for testing
- Set up price oracle infrastructure

**Key Contracts:**
- `oracles_and_mocks.move` - Price feeds and mock tokens
- `stapt_staking.move` - Real APT staking with treasury

### Phase 2: Tokenization (SY Wrapper & PT/YT)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Implemented the core yield tokenization mechanics:
- Built SY (Standardized Yield) wrapper for stAPT
- Created PT/YT splitting mechanism (1:1 ratio)
- Added support for multiple maturities (3M, 6M, 1Y)
- Implemented redemption logic for mature PT tokens

**Key Contracts:**
- `sy_wrapper.move` - stAPT to SY conversion
- `pt_yt_tokenization.move` - SY to PT/YT splitting
- `token_contracts.move` - Token implementations

### Phase 3A: Multi-LP Staking
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Added multiple liquidity pools with dynamic yields:
- Created 3 staking pools (stAPT-USDC, stAPT-BTC, stAPT-ETH)
- Implemented dynamic APY calculation (10-12% base + fees)
- Built auto-routing to highest yield pool
- Added pool metrics tracking

**Key Contracts:**
- `multi_lp_staking.move` - Multi-pool staking system

### Phase 3B: PT/YT AMM
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Built a constant product AMM for PT/YT trading:
- Implemented x*y=k formula for price discovery
- Added 0.3% trading fee mechanism
- Created liquidity provision system with LP tokens
- Built implied APY calculation from market prices

**Key Contracts:**
- `pt_yt_amm.move` - Simulated AMM (legacy)
- `pt_yt_amm_real.move` - Real token AMM

### Phase 4: Real Token Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Complete - MAJOR UPGRADE

Upgraded from simulation to real token transfers:
- Migrated to Aptos native coin framework
- Implemented real minting/burning with capabilities
- Created treasury system holding actual reserves
- Added proper coin registration and transfers

**Key Contracts:**
- `coin_types.move` - All coin type definitions
- `deploy_real_tokens.move` - One-click deployment
- `test_real_tokens.move` - Comprehensive test suite

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
APT (Native)
    ↓ stake
stAPT (9.5% APY)
    ↓ wrap
SY-stAPT (Standardized Yield)
    ↓ split
PT-stAPT + YT-stAPT
    ↓ trade
AMM Pool (x*y=k)
```

### Token Flow
1. **Stake**: User deposits APT → receives stAPT (earning 9.5% APY)
2. **Wrap**: User deposits stAPT → receives SY tokens (1:1)
3. **Split**: User deposits SY → receives PT + YT (1:1 each)
4. **Trade**: User swaps PT ↔ YT on AMM
5. **Redeem**: At maturity, PT → SY → stAPT → APT

### Treasury System
- **APT Treasury**: Holds real APT backing stAPT
- **stAPT Treasury**: Holds real stAPT backing SY
- **SY Treasury**: Holds real SY backing PT/YT
- **AMM Reserves**: Hold real PT and YT for trading

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Yields
- **stAPT APY**: 9.5% (auto-compounding)
- **Multi-LP Pools**: 10-12% base APY
- **AMM Trading Fee**: 0.3%

### Token Economics
- **stAPT/APT**: Dynamic exchange rate (increases with yield)
- **SY/stAPT**: 1:1 conversion
- **PT/SY**: 1:1 at split, market-driven after
- **YT/SY**: 1:1 at split, market-driven after

### Maturities
- **3 Month**: Short-term yield trading
- **6 Month**: Medium-term positions
- **1 Year**: Long-term yield locking

## 💡 Use Cases

### For Yield Farmers
- Lock in current yields by selling YT
- Speculate on future yields by buying YT
- Earn trading fees as LP provider

### For Risk-Averse Users
- Buy PT for guaranteed principal return
- Avoid yield volatility
- Fixed-income like returns

### For Speculators
